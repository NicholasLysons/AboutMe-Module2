README.md

-This project was done to show all aboout what we are able to achieve and also all what we have learned. So far what this project is to show is our skills in HTML and CSS, which we have grown in since the very beginning.I 
have always been interested in learning all the languages and forms of code
since I was very young, I believe with the knowledge that I have learned, I will soon be at that point.

-How this project is suppossed to display our skills ans what we have learned is shown through our portfolio development. From the start of this class I was unable to read any code, nor had any skills in any forms of it. But not through what I have learned in this class and what is shown through my portfolio shows how much I have developed through the hurdles that I have overcome to be where I am now.
